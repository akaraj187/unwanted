    "The Solution: Automation (Calculus)This is exactly why we need Calculus.Instead of us guessing \"+0.5\", we calculate the Derivative. The Derivative looks at User 0, User 1, and User 2 simultaneously and tells us:\"If you move up, User 0 gains 5 points but User 2 loses 7 points. Therefore, the smart move is to go DOWN.\""
