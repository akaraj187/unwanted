ArduPilot/ardupilot,TemperatureSensor: Add Rangefinder to the TEMPx_SRC sensor source options,"## Feature request

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Rover (and [hopefully soon Sub](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/pull/31622)) make use of a `WATER_DEPTH` MAVLink message, which includes temperature data from a downward-facing rangefinder. Rangefinders don't always include temperature sensors (or they may not be super accurate), so it could be nice to be able to sub that in from a dedicated temperature sensor.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Add a `Rangefinder` option to the temperature sensor [source options](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/blob/master/libraries/AP_TemperatureSensor/AP_TemperatureSensor_Params.h#L43), to allow the rangefinder driver temperature data to be overshadowed via the [`TEMPx_SRC`](https://ardupilot.org/sub/docs/parameters.html#temp1-src-sensor-source) parameters.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
1. The `WATER_DEPTH` message could automatically fall back to another temperature source if one is provided, but that either reliant on the rangefinder not providing temperature data, or makes it ambiguous as to what is being used
2. The source could be specified as ""water temperature"" instead of specifically rangefinder, which could make it more broadly useful in future, but also makes it less clear when and where it's likely to be used.
3. We could add dedicated MAVLink reporting for temperature sensors, and/or specifically for water temperature, which are both potentially good ideas, but then it's potentially unclear what source is being used for the temperature data in the `WATER_DEPTH` message

ArduPilot/ardupilot,Sub: add support for `WATER_DEPTH` MAVLink reporting,"## Feature request

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Many underwater vehicles have downward facing sonar sensors that are capable of measuring the distance to the water floor. Currently those are reported via [`DISTANCE_SENSOR`](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#DISTANCE_SENSOR) and [`RANGEFINDER`](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/ardupilotmega.html#RANGEFINDER) MAVLink messages, but both of those have limited export utility without contextual information that then needs to be cross-referenced with other messages (at risk of being incorrect from timing deltas).

Water temperature is also ambiguously reported in ArduSub via `SCALED_PRESSURE*` messages, which requires a receiver to know which and how many temperature sensors are connected to determine which one(s) refer to the water (e.g. outside the enclosure).

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Rover [has support for](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/pull/28875) a [`WATER_DEPTH`](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/ardupilotmega.html#WATER_DEPTH) message for boats, which seems to include most of the relevant information to be directly usable in map creation / bathymetry situations, and for high level autopilot state reporting. It seems reasonable to expand that support to ArduSub firmware.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Do nothing, which keeps things difficult for control station software, and keeps them reliant on cycling/filtering through `DISTANCE_SENSOR` and `SCALED_PRESSURE` messages for water depth and temperature estimates.

ArduPilot/ardupilot,AP_Gripper: support HOLD command option,"## Feature request

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Explicit gripper control is currently limited to active releasing and grabbing, which leaves out stopped/neutral operation. The EPM gripper driver seemingly has an option to automatically return to neutral some fixed time after a grab or release, but that is privately scoped and has no direct control action.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
1. MAVLink [now supports a HOLD command for grippers](https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink/pull/2393), which I think should be used to trigger stopped / neutral functionality of the gripper.
2. With drivers that expose that functionality, it could also be integrated into AUX functions / joystick button function support, as the return point when a grab or release button stops being held.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
We could just not implement this, but it's a missing functionality that seems useful for certain gripper types and applications.

**Additional context**
The lack of this functionality is what has thus far stopped ArduSub from regularly using ArduPilot's gripper functionality (opting to instead use momentary servo commands via joystick buttons), so this would reduce ArduSub's reliance on joystick button functions, while also making gripper configuration more intuitive.",['good first issue'],1

ArduPilot/ardupilot,EAHRS is performing duplicate temperature compenstation,"## Bug report

**Issue details**

Certain devices exposed through EAHRS, like the MicroStrain7, supply data that is already temperature compenstated.

https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.microstrain.com/GQ7+User+Manual/external_content/dcp/Data/sensor_data/data/mip_field_sensor_scaled_mag.htm
https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.microstrain.com/GQ7+User+Manual/external_content/dcp/Data/sensor_data/data/mip_field_sensor_scaled_accel.htm

When the External AHRS driver posts data to sensor libraries, they perform temperature compenstation on it again, as long as `HAL_INS_TEMPERATURE_CAL_ENABLE` is defined, which is based on board size.  

_Please describe the problem_

This causes double temperature compensation, leading to incorrect values.

**Proposed Solution**
Add `bool is_temperature_compensated;` to `AP_ExternalARHS::ins_data_message_t`, and then add the necessary hooks in `AP_InertialSensor::handle_external(const AP_ExternalAHRS::ins_data_message_t &pkt)` to stop doing temperature compensation if the supplied value is already temp-compensated.

See `ryanf55:eahrs-precompensated-sensors` for a prototype fix (WIP)

Right now, there is no way to enable the internal logging on the PX1 GNSS  because the API is only available over the ethernet web UI. Internal logging is used for tech support to analyze system performance. Since PX1 has little flight hours on small fixed wing drones, this is particularly useful to have the ArduPilot community be able to supply logs.

## Further details

The following binary data commands are what need to be sent for logging. There is no TransNumber, so just hard code these in the implementation file. If there is an ACK, parse the ACK.
```
Start Logging: 02 00 4C 09 08 44 45 46 41 55 4C 54 00 62 03 
Stop Logging: 02 00 4C 09 09 44 45 46 41 55 4C 54 00 63 03
```

## Dependencies

The configuration ack/nack pattern from `gsof-49-50` branch needs to be merged in before there is ability to do configuration responses. This ticket could be done without acks, however it will need to be changed.

ArduPilot/ardupilot,Set Servo options triggered by failsafe,"

## Feature request


For UAS which perform a function controlled by Set_servo outputs, such as crop spraying, it would be desirable for the UAS to stop doing the function if a failsafe mode is triggered. It is not clear if the Sprayer functionality includes this but it may be useful for other  applications such as vectored thrust VTOLs etc

Currently the consequence of RC signal loss while spraying would be the UAS performing a RTL while still spraying. This would be VERY BAD as the spray would be released at a high altitude and subsequently drift to unintended locations. 

**Describe the solution you'd like**
_A clear and concise description of what you want to happen._

A parameter to set servo outputs should failsafe be triggered Eg SERVOXX_FS_VALUE = 1000 


**Describe alternatives you've considered**
_A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered._

checked the Sprayer functionality in ardupilot, it is unclear if this issue is addressed. 

(Also documentation on ""SPRAY_SPINNER Spinner rotation speed: Spinner's rotation speed in PWM (a higher rate will disperse the spray over a wider area horizontally)"" is inaccurate and could cause serious issues, increased RPM actually creates smaller droplets.  see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_atomizers)

ArduPilot/ardupilot,AP_DDS: Support IMU+gyro+accel data for rate control or offboard fusion,"From AP_AHRS, the data is filtered and good for rate control. This is the data after notch+low pass, phase lag and all. This goes on `imu_filtered` topic.

For offboard fusion, we can do it ""badly"". We would need delta angle, delta velocity, all the data products from INS that are not filtered. We have to know the lag to do delayed time fusion with lag on the GPS. This would be on `imu_raw`.

Current EKF does delayed time fusion (in delayed time) with forward propagation to the current time. Doesn't work as well in dynamic flight.  Researchers want to do this.

ArduPilot/ardupilot,Make more features configurable,"## Cleanup request

Our new build server (https://custom.ardupilot.org) allows users to make their own firmwares by selecting and de-selecting features.

Sometimes the amount of code required to run a feature exceeds the flash space available on boards.

The more things we allow users to remove from the compilation the more likely they are to get a firmware that does everything they want.

A good example of this is scripting - users of 1MB boards would love to have it, but it is a large chunk of code and excluded from the 1MB builds by default.

*note* - each of these libraries can and should be done as a separate Pull Request!

There are many places in the code that we could allow users to exclude chunks of code on a piece-by-piece basis, for example:
 - rangefinder library
 - visual odometry backends
 - AC_Avoid

 - DONE AP_Winch backends
 - DONE GPS backends (@Hwurzburg is currently looking at these)
 - DONE rangefinder backends
 - DONE precision landing library
 - DONE compass backends
 - DONE airspeed backends
 - DONE AP_Mount backends
 - DONE battery monitor backends
 - DONE AP_Winch
 - DONE AP_MSP backends
 - DONE optical flow library
 - DONE optical flow backends
 - DONE RCInput backends (e.g. srxl)
 - DONE FRSky library
 - DONE FRSky backends

The larger the amount of code excised the more useful the change is.  `nm` can be used to show the largest symbols in the compiled code:

```


There are also some large wins available by filling out `AP_NavEKF3_features.h` with more options.  This work will be much more complicated, but the ability to, for example, exclude magnetometers from the EKF's calculations would save a very large amount of code. ~~(see https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/issues/19070 however)~~

The pattern we use is `AP_<foo>_ENABLED`.  An example of this is `AP_QUADPLANE_ENABLED`.  Typically the main library header will contain:
```
#ifndef AP_GPS_NOVA_ENABLED
#define AP_GPS_NOVA_ENABLED 1
#endif
```

The new option should also be added to the custom build server configuration: https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/blob/master/Tools/scripts/build_options.py 

The code *must* be tested for compilation and working-ness with and without the option set.

Previously when I've done this I've created a table, the left-most column being the most recent tested master commit, the columns sorted by git history.  This allows you to narrow down to a narrow range of commits where a board's build was broken.

However, a quicker patch giving a lot of value would be to extract the data in autotest.py's build_binaries.py and do a `results.add()` for the failing boards.  Only the failures for the master commit (as opposed to the stable/beta tags) would be reported as the story is too difficult to tell otherwise.

We need to cut back on the number of tests we run on CI (so they finish faster, given we can't reasonably increase the resources allocated there).  However, we still want more tests overall.  The autotest results tend to get ignored a lot of the time.

We should first verify that the issue is real by setting a second SERVOx_FUNCTION for throttle and then compare it's output to the the servo3 outputs and see if they're different.

The solution might to one of these:

- call the motors init regularly (1hz?) while the vehicle is disarmed
- add boolean values of whether various frame types have been enabled (i..e the return value of have_skid_steering()) and then regularly check if the true/false value has changed and if it has call the init() function again.

ArduPilot/ardupilot,AP_RangeFinder: TerraRangeI2C should use non-block semaphore in update(),"As discussed in [this PR related to the Maxbotix I2C rangefinder driver](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/pull/8471), the TeraRangerI2C driver should take use semaphore using non-blocking instead of BLOCK_FOREVER from within the [update function](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/blob/master/libraries/AP_RangeFinder/AP_RangeFinder_TeraRangerI2C.cpp#L156).

The reason is that the update() function is called from the mainloop so in the unlikely case that the I/O thread locks up, this would cause the main thread to also lockup.  Of course, the I/O thread locking up would likely lead to a crash anyway as I think we would not receive updates from the main IMU either.","['Library', 'good first issue']",1

ArduPilot/ardupilot,MAVlink library prevents OSD from receiving RSSI from 3DR modems,"#### Issue details

ArduPilot/ardupilot,handle_mission_write_partial_list is too strict,"#### Issue details

Currently `GCSCommon.cpp@handle_mission_write_partial_list` checks if the partial waypoint list is inside the current mission count boundary unnecessarily. This limits the utility of partial waypoint writing modifications because we can never expand the mission count.

A very simple case is appending a waypoint to a waypoint list. As far as I know a full rewrite of the mission plan would be required because the only other way to change the waypoint list is sending a `mavlink_msg_mission_count*` message with the previous mission count plus one. This is exactly what a partial list is for.

Removing the upper bound checks would not result in a problem because `GCS_Common.cpp@GCS_MAVLINK::handle_mission_item:839` already handles the case where the mission seq is bigger than mission.num_commands().

Am I wrong in these assumptions? If theoretically there is no problem I can produce a patch removing the upper bound checks.

ArduPilot/ardupilot,`LOG_FILE_DSRMROT`: allow to work with replay,"## Feature request

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

Our setup currently uses a CubeOrange+ flight controller paired with a separate system-controller MCU, each with independent logging systems. To troubleshoot recurring EKF issues (such as altitude discontinuities), we have enabled EKF_REPLAY with LOG_DISARMED set to always on, as recommended in the documentation for effective replay functionality.

However, LOG_DISARMED causes the flight controller to continuously log to a single .bin file across multiple flights until reboot is performed. We usually like to separate our system's log per flight. This makes it relatively troublesome to correlate flight controller logs with our system-controller logs on a per-flight basis, as each flight’s data is embedded within one large file rather than segmented by flight event.

At the moment, the workaround that we have done to correlate the flight controller logs and the system controller logs is that we have a separate lua script that captures the current bin file number and transmit it over CAN which is stored in the system controller log. This makes it relatively easier to find the correct flight logs, but the issue where the flight logs gets really big (~300MB or potentially even more) still stands.


**Describe the solution you'd like**
I was wondering if it would be possible that another feature be added where maybe, the log stops being recorded X seconds after the drone is disarmed, and then it creates a new log file afterwards. This would potentially allow us to have 1 log per flight, instead of having multiple flights being recorded (before a reboot is done) in a single bin file which can be quite annoying to analyse.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Up until now, to reduce the file size, we performed the following workaround:
- Reboot the flight controller prior to every flight test (not entirely practical once out in the field) to capture one flight per log
- Transmit the current .bin file number over CAN through the use of lua script to simplify the process of finding the corresponding BIN files to the system controller logs. We can then use the timestamps from our system controller logs and the flight controller logs to find the exact flight event.
- Disable INS logging unless necessary to reduce the file size

ArduPilot/ardupilot,"gimbal_device_id == 0 should control all gimbals, not primary","## Bug report

For the commands listed below, a gimbal device id == 0 is, per the MAVLink spec, intended for *all* gimbal devices.
On current `master`, it sometimes (always?) instead refers to the ""primary"" device.
This seems a simple mistake. This issue's purpose is to fix it.

Because fixing it will cause a change in behavior, the fix should be done concurrent with usage spots. Here are some, please comment below if you know of others:
- MP's 'payload' screen uses a default value of 0. Users expect this to control the primary gimbal, not all. (Perhaps switch default to 1, with a dropdown for user to select ""ALL"" if that's desired.)
- The auto mode similarly defaults to 0. (Perhaps do the same type of fix: default to 1 instead.)

ArduPilot/ardupilot,Native Ship / Moving Platform Landing Support for ArduCopter,"Currently, ArduCopter does not provide a native, documented way to land on a moving platform (e.g. ship deck) comparable to the existing Plane / QuadPlane ship landing support.

While Plane has:

SIM_SHIP_ENABLE

Built-in ship simulation

Documented RTL-based landing logic

Official examples and Lua scripts

ArduCopter users must rely on:

External Rover “beacon” vehicles

Undocumented FOLLOW behavior

Custom Lua scripts

Trial-and-error configuration

This makes ship landing with Copter difficult, fragile, and inconsistent, especially in SITL and for research/testing use cases.",[],0
ArduPilot/ardupilot,Bosch BMP581 baro intermittent I2C read errors,"## Bug report

**Issue details**

We are testing Bosch BMP581 as a replacement barometer on Pixhawk 6X due to ICP20100 and BMP388 being discontinued.

It seems like 
	1.	BMP581 works fine on I2C2.
	2.	On I2C4, we see intermittent bad samples that show up as large spikes in pressure or baro altitude. Logic analyzer suggests occasional I2C glitches. This seems like bus reliability or recovery behavior rather than a sensor algorithm issue.

ArduPilot/ardupilot,SIGFPE via incorrect type conversion on fence file upload,"## Bug report

**Issue details**
A **SIGFFPE** signal is raised in functions **_convert_MISSION_ITEM_INT_to_AC_PolyFenceI_item_int_** ([MissionItemProtocol_Fence.cpp](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/blob/master/libraries/GCS_MAVLink/MissionItemProtocol_Fence.cpp)) and/or _**is_positive**_ ([AP_Math.h)](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/blob/master/libraries/AP_Math/AP_Math.cpp)) during an attempted upload of a crafted fence files with invalid values of parameter **_param1_**. Floating point exception occurs due to unchecked type conversions, leading to immediate autopilot process termination and loss of GCS – vehicle communication. 


**Steps to reproduce**
Vulnerability can be triggered by uploading fence files with parameters set to invalid values:

1. **_fence-oor.txt_** – with **_param1_** set to “_**-1e+10**_” (minus 10 billion)
```
QGC WPL 110
0	0	0	5001	-1e+10		0	0	0	0	0	0	0
```
2. _**fence-nan.txt**_  - with **_param1_** set to “_NaN_” (Not-a-Number)
```
QGC WPL 110
0	0	0	5003	 NaN		0	0	0	0	0	0	0
```
To reproduce the vulnerability for ArduCopter in SITL environment, follow below steps:

1. Run SITL simulation for ArduCopter in debug mode
    `$ Tools/autotest/sim_vehicle.py -v ArduCopter --console --map -w -D -G -ubsan`

2. Wait for vehicle to initialize into PreArm state
   `pre-arm good`

3. Upload one of the fence files to the vehicle using MAVProxy GCS console
```
> fence load fence-oor.txt
> fence load fence-nan.txt
```

4. Observe GCS connection and vehicle process termination

```
Sent all 1 fence items

```

Exception raised for **_fence-oor.txt_**

(gdb) print fVal1
$7 = nan(0x400000)
```

Backtrace shows that both input files had a similar effect upon upload, resulting in the FPE due to unchecked type conversions, but raised in different parts of the code:

1. **_fence-oor.txt_** - function **_convert_MISSION_ITEM_INT_to_AC_PolyFenceI_item_int_** responsible for converting MAVLink mission item into an **_AC_PolyFenceItem_** structure,
performs an unchecked assignment of **_param1_** value to **_vertex_count_** of type _uint_8_t_.
2. **_fence-nan.txt_** - function **_is_positive_**, which simply checks whether a float is greater than zero, makes a float-to-NaN comparison between **_fVal1_** (holding _**param1**_ value) and **_FLT_EPSILON_** (of type float), which raises floating-point operation exception. 

**Root cause**
The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of sufficient validation of parameters carried by **_param1_**, allowing out-of-range or non-numerical values to trigger an unhandled exception. Existing sanitization routine performs none or minimal input validation by doing only upper bound check (>255) for selected parameters, making it highly insufficient. 
Also keep in mind that demonstrated examples exploit only single case for specific 
commands (5001 and 5003), but the same vulnerability is present in all fence-specific commands:

- _MAV_CMD_NAV_FENCE_POLYGON_VERTEX_INCLUSION_  (5001) for  **_vertex_count_** =<(_-1e+10_)
- _MAV_CMD_NAV_FENCE_POLYGON_VERTEX_EXCLUSION_  (5002) for **_vertex_count_** =<(_-1e+10_)
- _MAV_CMD_NAV_FENCE_CIRCLE_EXCLUSION_  (5003) for **_radius_** == _NaN_
- _MAV_CMD_NAV_FENCE_CIRCLE_EXCLUSION_  (5004) for **_radius_** == _NaN_


**Impact**
The impact of this vulnerability is severe, affecting both operational reliability and flight safety across all ArduPilot vehicles. When an attacker in the network or unintentional operator uploads improperly constructed fence file, the autopilot software immediately crashes due to unhandled exception. As a direct result, the connection between the GCS and the vehicle is abruptly lost, so any ongoing automated mission is terminated. For vehicle in the air, this loss of control may lead to dangerous situations including uncontrolled flight, failure to perform failsafe procedures, or even a crash.

**Recommendation**
Enforce strict input validation and bounds checking on all externally supplied fence parameters before they are stored or used in arithmetic operations.

ArduPilot/ardupilot,SIGFPE via incorrect type conversion on mission file upload,"## Bug report

**Issue details**

A **SIGFFPE** signal is raised in the function **_mavlink_int_to_mission_cmd_** ([AP_Mission.cpp](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/blob/master/libraries/AP_Mission/AP_Mission.cpp))  during an attempted upload of a crafted mission file with invalid values of parameter **_param1_**.
Floating point exception occurs due to unchecked float-to-integer type conversion, leading to immediate autopilot process termination and loss of Ground Control Station (GCS)   – vehicle communication.

**Steps to reproduce**

Vulnerability is triggered by uploading mission file with **_param1_** set to out-of-range value. 
That leads to failure during unchecked _**float**_ (32 bit) to **_uint_16_t_** (16 bit) conversion in _**mavlink_int_to_mission_cmd**_ ([AP_Mission.cpp](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/blob/master/libraries/AP_Mission/AP_Mission.cpp))  function. Below demonstration uses a sample crafted mission file following plain-text format, with param1 set to **_1e+10_** (10 billion), that was uploaded to ArduCopter using MAVProxy _**wp load**_ method. 

```
QGC WPL 110
0	0	0	0	1e+10	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
```
To reproduce the vulnerability for ArduCopter in SITL environment, follow below steps:

1. Run SITL simulation for ArduCopter in debug mode
    `$ Tools/autotest/sim_vehicle.py -v ArduCopter --console --map -w -D -G `
2. Wait for vehicle to initialize into PreArm state
     `pre-arm good`
3. Upload mission file to the vehicle using MAVProxy GCS console
    `> wp load mission.txt`
4. Observe GCS connection and vehicle process termination

Thread 1 ""arducopter"" received signal SIGFPE, Arithmetic exception.
AP_Mission::mavlink_int_to_mission_cmd (packet=..., cmd=...)
    at ../../libraries/AP_Mission/AP_Mission.cpp:1103
1103            cmd.p1 = packet.param1;
(gdb) print cmd.p1
$1 = 0
(gdb) print packet.param1
$2 = 1e+10
```


**Root cause**

Backtrace of the error shows that insecure type conversion occurs within the **_mavlink_int_to_mission_cmd_**   ([AP_Mission.cpp](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/blob/master/libraries/AP_Mission/AP_Mission.cpp)) function, which converts MAVLink message into a **_Mission_Command_** object to be stored in EEPROM vehicle memory. SIGFPE signal is raised at line 1103 due to an arithmetic exception caused by an unsafe assignment between mismatched types with vastly different ranges.
- **_packet.param1_** is a 32-bit float
- **_cmd.p1_** is a 16-bit unsigned integer

The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of sufficient bounds checking on **_param1_** prior to type conversion, allowing out-of-range values to trigger a hardware exception. Existing sanitization function **_sanity_check_params_** only performs minimal validation by rejecting infinite or selectively NaN values for parameters 1–4 and does not enforce any command-specific numeric ranges or limits, making this protection highly insufficient.


**Impact**
The impact of this vulnerability is severe, affecting both operational reliability and flight safety across all affected ArduPilot vehicles including ArduCopter, ArduRover and ArduSub. When an attacker in the network or unintentional operator uploads improperly constructed mission file, the autopilot software immediately crashes due to unhandled exception.  As a direct result, the connection between the GCS and the vehicle is abruptly lost, so any ongoing automated mission is terminated. For vehicle in the air, this loss of control may lead to dangerous situations including uncontrolled flight, failure to perform failsafe procedures, or even a crash.


**Recommendations**
Enforce strict input validation and bounds checking on all externally supplied mission parameters before they are stored or used in arithmetic operations.

ArduPilot/ardupilot,Provide a method to get a binary log of all serial data,"## Feature request

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

I have a serial port, currently configured for a mavlink connection. The autopilot is not accessible when the vehicle is assembled. I want to have an easy way to decode traffic on the port. If it was, I'd use a Saleae logic analyzer, decode as async serial, and then run use pymavlink to decode the stream.

I cant use the mavlink inspector in mission planner because this is an internal connection in the vehicle, and some packets on this mavlink interface are not also repeated on the GCS link.

**Describe the solution you'd like**

Provide an option to enable logging for the serial port, which will log all data to a binary file on the SD card.
I can then use mavftp to transfer this to my computer and interpret the contents.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

Turning on LOG_REPLAY does not log serial port traffic.

ArduPilot/ardupilot,Drone fails to disarm in BRAKE mode while landed with low throttle (1050us),"## Bug report

**Issue details**
According to the [Brake mode documentation](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/brake-mode.html), ""If the vehicle is landed in Brake mode it will immediately disarm."" 
During testing, when the vehicle is on the ground with the throttle held at a low level (above minimum but insufficient for takeoff), switching to Brake mode does not trigger an immediate disarm. Instead, the motors continue to spin at an idle or low speed indefinitely.

Reproduce the steps:
1. mode acro

ArduPilot/ardupilot,Python 3.9 EOL while search for python.exe if sources cloned in WSL2,"## Bug report

**Issue details**

My initial report was here: https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot_vscode_devenv/issues/42

If ardupilot code was cloned in WSL2, then ""upload firmware to the controller"" task won't work. It generates an error:

```
WSL2 firmware uploads use the host's Windows Python.exe so it has access to the COM ports.

        Windows python.exe not found
        Please download Windows Installer 3.9.x (not 3.10) from https://www.python.org/downloads/
        and make sure to add it to your path during the installation. Once installed, run this
        command in Powershell or Command Prompt to install some packages:
        
        pip.exe install empy==3.3.4 pyserial
```

1) Python 3.9 is deprecated, and no installers are available on the python.org for it https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3925/. So maybe that error message should be removed/updated.

2) pyserial works fine in Python 3.12


I have fixed that this way:

ArduPilot/ardupilot,Unexpected Disarm in ACRO mode when Throttle at zero during GCS/RC Failsafe while airborne,"## Bug report

**Issue details**

In ACRO mode, if the vehicle is airborne and the throttle is at the minimum position, triggering an GCS/RC Failsafe causes the copter to immediately disarm in mid-air.

While the ""Disarm on low throttle"" logic is expected on the ground, it should not be triggered when the flight controller detects the vehicle is still in flight (Airborne), especially during a failsafe event where a controlled RTL or Land is expected.

See line 472:
https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/blob/cef6eb780255cc398657a97aa4ef13e438296490/ArduCopter/events.cpp#L463-L482

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Take off and switch to ACRO mode.
2. Lower the throttle stick to the minimum position.
3. param set FS_THR_VALUE -1 (trigger an RC Failsafe)/param set FS_GCS_TIMEOUT 0 (trigger a GCS Failsafe).
4. The copter disarms immediately and falls.
5. Expected Result: The copter should trigger the configured Failsafe action (e.g., RTL or Land) regardless of the throttle position, as long as it is airborne.

I found a buffer overflow vulnerability in ArduPilot:

1. ESP32 WiFi drivers:
   - In libraries/AP_HAL_ESP32/WiFiDriver.cpp and WiFiUdpDriver.cpp, strcpy is used to copy SSID and password into fixed-size buffers.
2. SITL XPlane connector:
   - In libraries/SITL/SIM_XPlane.cpp, strcpy is used to copy dataref names into fixed-size buffers.

Using strings longer than the buffer size can cause stack-buffer-overflow and program crash. 
I verified this using a minimal test case compiled with AddressSanitizer.

ArduPilot/ardupilot,[SITL + ardupilot_gazebo] Iris with 3-DOF gimbal: gimbal jumps to an unexpected pose during SITL startup initialization,"## Bug report

**Issue details**
**Steps to reproduce**

(1)Start the Gazebo world and model (the gimbal is initially aligned with the vehicle heading in Gazebo):
gz sim -v4 -r ~/ardupilot/ardupilot_gazebo/worlds/iris_runway.sdf
(2)Start SITL and load the gimbal parameter file:
./Tools/autotest/sim_vehicle.py -D -v ArduCopter -f JSON \
  --add-param-file=$HOME/work/ardupilot/ardupilot_gazebo/config/gazebo-iris-gimbal.parm \
  --console --map

**Expected behavior**

After starting SITL, the gimbal should not suddenly jump to an extreme pose during initialization. At minimum, it should remain aligned with the vehicle heading, or first stabilize to a predictable neutral/retract pose. If RC Targeting is the default mode, a more reasonable initial RC input is expected.

<img width=""261"" height=""175"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d239d0f-26f0-48b4-af37-4c872d763676"" />

**Actual behavior**

After starting SITL, the gimbal in Gazebo quickly twists to a strange orientation, and the initial pose aligned with the vehicle heading is broken.
Early RC inputs captured from RC_CHANNELS are:
chan6_raw=1000
chan7_raw=1000
chan8_raw=1800
Meanwhile, the parameter file configures the calibration range for RC6/7/8 as RCx_MIN=1100, RCx_MAX=1900, so the raw values at startup are below the configured lower bound (at least CH6/7: 1000 < 1100).
Early gimbal attitude captured from GIMBAL_DEVICE_ATTITUDE_STATUS:
q = [0.3921, 0.7231, -0.5320, 0.2010] (w, x, y, z)
The Euler angles converted from this quaternion show a large-angle combination.

ArduPilot/ardupilot,ESC to RPM sensor processing,"## Feature request

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

* AM32 ESCs sometimes report RPM values that are significantly out of range (50k+ RPM on a motor that spins at 4k RPM). Thist mostly happens during spool up causing heli governor using ESC RPM telemetry to fail to engage)
* BDShot RPM telemetry (on AM32 ESCs) is jittery ±10RPM jitter at 4k RPM which probably messes with the Ardupilot governor, causing throttle jitter.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Adding lowpass filter to RPM library and respecting RPMx_MAX when taking data from ESC telemetry would alleviate these issues. At the cost of slightly decreased governor tracking accuracy

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

* Checking that the governor is engaged prior to takeoff
* Kickstarting the motor with the interlock to avoid the issue
* Cycling the interlock to re-engage the governor 
* Using throttle curve (not feasible due to large voltage range and apparent lack of voltage compensation)

It's not technically a problem, just not very user friendly from a good user interface standpoint. It's also pretty jarring for existing QGC+ArduPilot users coming from older firmwares where QGC was in control of flight mode names and used Mixed Case everywhere with no underscores.
* Also the list of flight modes is massively long. I don't know if some of these flight modes returned fall into the category of not-selectable by a user.

ArduPilot/ardupilot,Copter SITL Webots-Python: iris.parm incompatible with current pre-arm validation,"## Bug report

**Issue details**

Please take these findings with a grain of salt.

When using ArduCopter SITL with the Webots `webots-python` model and the provided `iris.parm`, I am seeing inconsistent and sometimes blocking pre-arm behavior on newer commits. The same workflow and Webots world arm and fly reliably when rolling back to the previous commit.

On the newer commit, arming is frequently blocked by pre-arm checks and parameter validation errors, such as:

* `Bad parameter: ATC_RAT_RLL_I must be > 0`
* `PreArm: Check ACRO_BAL_ROLL/PITCH`
* `Arm: Accels inconsistent`

Arming behavior is inconsistent between runs. Sometimes the vehicle arms, sometimes it does not, even with the same setup. Once armed, the vehicle flies normally in Webots.

Rolling back to the immediately previous commit resolves all issues without any manual parameter changes, which suggests a regression or a parameter compatibility issue rather than a Webots model problem.

ArduPilot/ardupilot,"Copter: Dijkastras may get stuck if ""Allow fast waypoints"" options is enabled and WPNAV_RADIUS > 2 and","If users set the OA_OPTIONS bit ""Allow fast waypoints"" and set WPNAV_RADIUS > 2 the vehicle may get stuck as it flies a path provided by Dijkstras (e.g. a path around a fence)

The core problem is that [OA_PathPlanner](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/blob/master/libraries/AC_Avoidance/AP_OAPathPlanner.h) is responsible for returning the next two waypoints that the vehicle should fly to but it doesn't know when AC_WPNav has actually completed these waypoints.  [The code here](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/blob/master/libraries/AC_Avoidance/AP_OADijkstra.cpp#L224) tries to figure this out using the vehicle's current location but it assumes the vehicle will come within 2m of the point which it may actually not if ""allow fast waypoints"" is enabled.

The problematic [line is here](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/blob/master/libraries/AC_Avoidance/AP_OADijkstra.cpp#L224) and copied below

`const bool near_oa_wp = current_loc.get_distance(destination_new) <= 2.0f;`

Here's an example mission and fence that exhibits the problem.  When the vehicle RTLs at the end

The proper solution is not as simple as just passing in the WPNAV_RADIUS to Dijkstras though because while this parameter sets an **upper limit** on how far the vehicle may fly from the waypoint, the vehicle normally flies closer than this.  In fact a user could set the WPNAV_RADIUS = 100m and still the vehicle would fly quite close to the waypoints.  In this case if Dijkstras used 100m it would consider intermediate points complete far too early and would likely cut corners which could lead to breaching the fence.

I think the proper solution is to improve the interface between [AP_OAPathPlanner::mission_avoidance()](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/blob/master/libraries/AC_Avoidance/AP_OAPathPlanner.cpp#L196) and [AP_OADijkstra::update()](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/blob/master/libraries/AC_Avoidance/AP_OADijkstra.cpp#L50) (which is currently passing back and forth [avoidance_info stuctures](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/blob/master/libraries/AC_Avoidance/AP_OAPathPlanner.h#L98)) so that Dijkstras provides not just the next two intermediate points but instead the entire path around the obstacle.

Then [AC_WPNav_OA](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/blob/master/libraries/AC_WPNav/AC_WPNav_OA.h) should hold onto this path and take responsibility for feeding the next two points into the [AC_WPNav base class](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/blob/master/libraries/AC_WPNav/AC_WPNav.h).  AC_WPNav_OA can do this better than Dijkstras because it can keep track of where the vehicle is along the path by calling the base classes's [reached_wp_destination()](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/blob/master/libraries/AC_WPNav/AC_WPNav.h#L240C18-L240C40) method

BTW, I've done some work in [this PR to restructure Dijkstras](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/pull/28542).  We should consider merging this restructure to master and converting AC_Avoidance to always use meters before trying to resolve this issue.","['BUG', 'Safety', 'Library']",0
ArduPilot/ardupilot,AC_PrecLand LOCAL_FRD support yaw rotation sign error,"## Bug report

**Issue details**

It appears that there is a sign error on the recently introduced support for LOCAL_FRD MAV_FRAME in the AC_PrecLand module. From my perspective it seems that ""_inertial_data_delayed->Tbn"" describes the rotation quaternion from the Body Frame to the NED frame. To rotate BODY_FRD (the previous, well tested MAV_FRAME used in AC_PrecLand) we rotate the FRD unit vector by the _intertial_data_delayed->Tbn quaternion to get NED Frame.

When doing this for LOCAL_FRD (which is yaw only, gravity aligned so no roll/pitch) we extract the Euler rotations from the BODY->NED quaternion and rotate by the Yaw only. This is correct, except that we are using rotate_xy( **-** yaw) which I believe to be incorrect.

I have flight-tested and proved this issue by changing my precision landing sensor from BODY_FRD (working) to LOCAL_FRD. Changing to this MAV_FRAME within the LANDING_TARGET message causes divergent behaviour any time the Copter is not aligned with North. If I remove the negative sign from the line below, I get comparable behaviour with BODY_FRD which is expected, as these are both body-yaw aligned frames.

Line in question:
https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/blob/master/libraries/AC_PrecLand/AC_PrecLand.cpp#L674

The functionality for LOCAL_FRD support was added in this PR: https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/pull/30446

I believe there also must be an issue in the Simulation environment somewhere as this issue was clearly not picked up during the pull request completion.

for MAV_CMD_NAV_RETURN_TO_LAUNCH and assigning `nan_mask = 0xf0` would be an ok compromise?

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I've tried from the other side, i.e. MAVSDK, but the values are hard-coded in the implementation.

ArduPilot/ardupilot,ALT_OFFSET error when commanding waypoint/flight mode,"## Bug report

**Issue details**

In summary, in ArduPlane, if you have the parameter ALT_OFFSET set (to say climb 300 meters), when you go to command the aircraft to a waypoint, TECS will somehow double the ALT_OFFSET leading to risk of an altitude excursion. Was able to replicate in SITL. I don't know if this is due to misuse of ALT_OFFSET, or if it's a bug with how it's interpretted

Additional information: When in an autonomous mission using ALT_OFFSET to change a mission altitude, vehicle climbs to target altitude without issue. However, when commanding the vehicle to a waypoint, or a flight mode change (circle/loiter), vehicle will enter a target altitude double ALT_OFFSET until vehicle reaches said waypoint, and then returns to the ALT_OFFSET. Risks causing altitude limit breach unless safeguard system used. Further testing will be done to determine if geofence can trip to RTL and return vehicle to ALT_OFFSET target altitude, or if commanding RTL will return vehicle to ALT_OFFSET target altitude.

Can hop on a dev call to discuss further

ArduPilot/ardupilot,"AP_TemperatureSensor_MLX90614: only reading ambient temp, not object temp - no indication in Wiki","While using the MLX90614 Sensor i noticed the same issue that @peterbarker noted in his merging comment: a bit low, and very long time constants. Only after holding hot soldering iron directly in front of the sensor, but the readings only changing slightly I figured there must be something seriously wrong. 

so i did some digging and sure enough, the driver only reads the internal (ambient) temp of the sensor, not the temp of the object https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/blob/a8b57dceadca306aabb3fcc351e3be4a411e5f49/libraries/AP_TemperatureSensor/AP_TemperatureSensor_MLX90614.cpp#L42C45-L42C56

Which is fine, but not what i would expect when using an infrared temp sensor. Also this is not noted in the wiki or elsewhere. 

My suggestion would be to add a config param to switch between the ambient temp and object temp - or to just use the object temp as default.

What are your thoughts? I can make a PR after some discussion.

ArduPilot/ardupilot,Feature request: Add Linux Mint “zara” codename mapping to install-prereqs.sh,"## **Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

The prerequisites installation script (`install-prereqs-ubuntu.sh`) does not currently recognize the Linux Mint codename **“zara”**, which corresponds to Linux Mint 22.2. When running the script on Mint “zara”, it fails during release detection with:

```
Unable to map zara to an Ubuntu release.
```

Because the script cannot translate the Mint codename to the correct Ubuntu base, installation halts prematurely.

## **Describe the solution you'd like**

Add a translation entry for Linux Mint **“zara” → Ubuntu “noble” (24.04)** within the existing Mint-to-Ubuntu mapping block:

```
linuxmint)
    case ${RELEASE_CODENAME} in
        wilma | xia | zara)
            RELEASE_CODENAME='noble'
            ;;
```

This ensures the script correctly detects the system and proceeds with the expected package installation.

## **Describe alternatives you've considered**

* Editing the script locally (works, but not ideal for other Mint users).
* Allowing users to manually override the Ubuntu codename (would require additional script logic).
* Failing early with a more descriptive message (does not solve the underlying mapping problem).

Adding the proper Mint → Ubuntu mapping is consistent with existing behavior and previous merged PRs.

I have tested the fix locally and confirmed that installation completes successfully after adding the mapping. A pull request with the change is ready to be submitted.

ArduPilot/ardupilot,AP_SCRIPTING: mavlink:send_chan() returns false intermittently,"## Bug report

**Issue details**

Hi, I'm trying to get send a command_long to another component (winch) on my aircraft. My ""winch"" is a nucleo32 that is listening for commands addressed to it. I have a lua script set up so that upon flipping a switch on my RC the script will see the change and send a command to the winch.
The problem I am having is that the mavlink:send_chan() function doesn't always send the message (and returns false). My nucleo can see every gcs:send_text() and can see that the lua script just doesn't send the command.

I have currently implemented a small workaround that just continually calls the send_chan function with the same parameters until it returns true (or reaches a stopping point) (And this still fails sometimes and no command is sent).  I'm pretty new to coding using the ardupilot scripting and I assume this isn't normal behavior for send_chan().

ArduPilot/ardupilot,Support RTL_ALTITUDE when using RTL_AUTOLAND,"## Feature request

We have a fixed-wing plane which has a complicated landing sequence, which forces us to always land in AUTO mode using `RTL_AUTOLAND` parameter. However, this means that `RTL_ALTITUDE` is ignored, since the vehicle always proceeds to the first waypoint after `MAV_CMD_DO_LAND_START`. I also need a way to support ""return at current altitude"", set when parameter is equal to -1.
The landing sequence contains `MAV_CMD_NAV_LOITER_TO_ALT` at 50m AGL which is required for final approach, but the plane glides to it in a straight descending line, potentially crashing into terrain.

*I would like the vehicle to complete the RTL route on altitude set in `RTL_ALTITUDE` parameter, also when landing in AUTO mode, and only descend when close to landing sequence.*

**Workaround**
By adding a `MAV_CMD_NAV_WAYPOINT` after `MAV_CMD_DO_LAND_START` and before `MAV_CMD_NAV_LOITER_TO_ALT`, I can adjust the return altitude on this mission item, and have the plane climb to it immediately by setting bit 14 of `FLIGHT_OPTIONS`. I am including the Lua function below.

The problem is, that **this script needs to reliably detect when RTL mode is triggered** to update the waypoint. When using `RTL_AUTOLAND` the vehicle switches to AUTO immediately, and I might miss it between the calls of the script. When changing the mode from GCS, I can listen to `MAV_CMD_DO_SET_MODE`, but can't detect RTL triggered by another script or RC transmitter. Finally, I can't simply look at the index of current waypoint, because I don't want to climb to RTL altitude when mission proceeds to landing sequence as planned.

**Additional context**
I'd be happy to contribute either a reliable way to detect RTL in Lua when using Automatic landing or some more involved behaviour for RTL, as preferred by the dev team.

I searched the issues for `RTL_AUTOLAND` and `RTL_ALTITUDE` but didn't find anything with both for my use case. There's a thread [Altitude behaviour on RTL using DO_LAND_START with RTL_AUTOLAND=2](https://discuss.ardupilot.org/t/altitude-behaviour-on-rtl-using-do-land-start-with-rtl-autoland-2/83922) which confirms that adding a waypoint is the way to do it.

```lua
-- Update first waypoint of landing sequence to recreate RTL_ALTITUDE behavior in AUTO
-- 
-- This must be called every time the vehicle enters RTL. Because the altitude target is specified
-- as a regular waypoint with large acceptance radius, the vehicle might not reach it if it's already close.
-- Note that if RTL is switched into AUTO and vehicle continues the mission it will fly to RTL altitude,
-- this can be reset to original value by reuploading the mission plan from GCS.
local function update_rtl_altitude()
    local doland_idx = find_do_land_start_index()
    if not doland_idx then
        return
    end

    local rtl_idx = doland_idx + 1
    local rtl_item = mission:get_item(rtl_idx)
    if (not rtl_item) or rtl_item:command() ~= MAV_CMD_NAV_WAYPOINT then
        return
    end

    local rtl_altitude = RTL_ALTITUDE:get()
    if not rtl_altitude then
        return
    end

    if rtl_altitude == -1 then
        local current_rel_alt = -ahrs:get_relative_position_D_home()
        rtl_item:z(current_rel_alt)
    else
        rtl_item:z(rtl_altitude)
    end

    -- Never write altitude smaller than 50 m
    if rtl_item:z() < 50 then
        rtl_item:z(50)
    end
    -- Ensure the altitude is relative to home like the parameter
    rtl_item:frame(MAV_FRAME_GLOBAL_RELATIVE_ALT)

    mission:set_item(rtl_idx, rtl_item)
    gcs:send_text(MAV_SEVERITY.NOTICE, string.format(""Doing RTL at %.0f m (REL)"", rtl_item:z()))

ArduPilot/ardupilot,Copter: Ch6 tuning of WP Speed overshoots during the beginning of the first leg,"Copter supports transmitter based tuning ([see wiki here](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-transmitter-tuning.html)) including the ability to adjust the speed during auto missions.  Unfortunately it seems this doesn't take effect immediately when auto starts so the vehicle will overspeed in the first segment of the mission.

The issue can be reproduced in SITL with AP-4.7.0-dev (or higher) by doing the following:

1. param set RC6_OPTION 219 (Transmitter Tuning)
2. param set TUNE 10 (WP Speed)
3. param set TUNE_MIN 100 (1m/s)
4. param set TUNE_MAX 1000 (10m/s)
5. param set AUTO_OPTIONS 3 (allow arming and takeoff in Auto mode)
6. create an auto mission with long segments (e.g. a big square)
7. auto
8. arm throttle
9. rc 6 1000

The vehicle should fly at 1m/s but instead it will fly at up to 6m/s for the first segment before slowing to 1m/s

ArduPilot doesn't start (immediately crashes) on STM32H7 boards where a PX4 bootloader is used. You can see the bootloader appear on USB and then disappear after a few seconds, and nothing happens after that.

Also see proposed (likely wrong) fix and discussion in https://github.com/ArduPilot/ChibiOS/pull/98.

FYI: @tpwrules, @andyp1per, @bugobliterator 

**To reproduce:**

1. Backup AP parameters in case you don't want to lose them!
2. Flash PX4 (e.g use QGroundControl and flash PX4 firmware. (It says stable 1.16 but in fact installs 1.17alpha1, which works to install the bootloader anyway)
3. In QGC, go to Analyze Tools -> MAVLink Console and run `bl_update /etc/extras/cubepilot_cubeorange_bootloader.bin` for CubeOrange or `bl_update /etc/extras/cubepilot_cubeorangeplus_bootloader.bin` for CubeOrange+.
(Alternatively, you can set param `SYS_BL_UPDATE` to `1` (Enabled) and reboot the board, however, this only works with 1.17/main but not 1.16 or 1.15 where it is broken.)

**Issue details**

In Arduplane 4.6.x stopped working option GPS_DRV_OPTION=4 (bitmask xxxxx1xx) to enforce GPS bitrate 115200.
This can be because parameter GPS_TYPE was removed in 4.6.3
In versions 4.5 and lower it was necessary to set GPS_TYPE=2 (ublox) to make GPS_DRV_OPTION=4 work (even it's not logical, it didn't work with autodetection, only with fixed GPS type.)
I'm using a GPS beacon ""sniffing"" on the GPS data which can't  work with bitrate higher than 115k.

ardupilot is subscribed to the topic `/vision/pose` and takes pose information from that to update.

ArduPilot/ardupilot,DSHOT issue with Ardu using 4in1 BLS ESC,"Hey! Having issues getting motors to run on a quad build with the SIYI N7 + 4-in-1 BLS ESC.

Video, gimbal control, telemetry, and RC link work fine, only motors don’t spin.

Hardware: N7 FC, SIYI GPS A8 Mini, HGLC BLS 4-in-1 ESC 60A 

Firmware: ArduCopter 4.5.7 / Quadcopter 

What happens:
• When I move motor outputs from MAIN 1–4 → AUX 1–4, ESCs initialise
• After reboot, servo outputs reset to 0 and motors stop responding. (photo below)
• ESC does not initialise, no beep tone. 

Tried:
• AUX1–4 for motors, MAIN disabled/GPIO
• DShot600, BLHeli autodetect, BLHeli32 mode
• Reset params → only set PWM=DShot
• Set servo outputs 9–13 as motors
• New N7, and HolyBro 6C FC + ArduCopter 4.5.7 (same problem)
• Changed ESC from BL32 to BLS (same problem)
• ESC/motors confirmed working on Betaflight
• Spent a week going through threads, chatted with SIYI directly, discord channel and have been referred to submit here, still no progress. Maybe a bug??

Anyone run DShot and had this happen? Any tips appreciated! :-) 

Param file attached.

ArduPilot/ardupilot,DroneCAN Deadlock in dronecan_0 Thread on CubeRed Hardware,"<img width=""470"" height=""464"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33d31672-fdb3-4f64-9e56-342adb5253f5"" />

## Bug report

**Setup**
[1] Mavproxy connecting to Cube Red via TCP connection and forwarding via out=udp:127.0.0.1:14550 onto my local machine
[2] DroneCan GUI Tool connected via MavCAN connection
[3] Cube Red configured as TCP server on LWIP stack

**Issue details**
Critical deadlock detected in the dronecan_0 thread (error code 83, 0x20000010) causing internal errors (0x8000) on CubeRed hardware. The deadlock appears to be related to a potential lock ordering issue in the DroneCAN pipeline. Issue is repeatable and occurs when using DroneCAN GUI Tool connected via MavCAN with MAVProxy forwarding TCP connections from a Cube Red configured as TCP server on LWIP stack.

ArduPilot/ardupilot,AP_DDS: Servo Control,"It would be great to receive all the servo output telemetry and send servo commands through DDS.

- `/ap/servo_out` and `/ap/servo_in` both of type `ardupilot_msgs/msg/Servo` which reports 32 channels.
- Any channel commanded that is between 800 and 2200 is considered a valid value to command.
- Maybe a protection in the config file to protect the first channels.
